## Setup & Installation

- Everything is easier if you have an environment manager. 
I recommend [Minicconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html), 
or [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) 
in a pinch. Miniconda just lives in the terminal and ends up causing less 
confusion, but both are pretty standard to see in the world.

**Conda/Miniconda Installation**

1. Open a terminal in this directory
2. Install environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml` 
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate strat`
4. ???
5. Profit ðŸ˜Ž

*NOTE*: You don't have to worry about your python version at all, since conda installs the correct version into this environments interpreter.

**Regular pip install**

1. Make sure you have a version of python 3.10 handy (`python --version`)
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
